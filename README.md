# Kirby Super Star PopTracker Pack

Tracker for Kirby Super Star Archipelago.

## Installation

Download the latest build or source, and either drag it onto the poptracker window and install, or put it in your packs folder

## NOTES

Autotracking currently does not work as the lua scripts are still being worked on.

Great Cave Offensive does not track gold requirements currently and will show all regions accessible once TGCO is received/selected.
