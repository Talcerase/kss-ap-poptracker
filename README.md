# Kirby Super Star PopTracker Pack

Tracker for Kirby Super Star Archipelago.

## Installation

Download the latest build or source, and either drag it onto the poptracker window and install, or put it in your packs folder

## NOTES

Autotracking is very close to fully working. The only thing not fully tracked currently is gold total. However, to circumvent this temporarily, once you've received enough gold to progress to the next area, clicking the gold medal icon will increase it by 1, and will show the next area in logic, for a maximum of 3. (0- Sub-Tree, 1- Crystal, 2- Old Tower, 3- Garden). This also means that, for now, the tracker will show that escape is in logic even if it is not, once you've unlocked Garden.
